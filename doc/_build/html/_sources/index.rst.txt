DESI Tutorials
==============

Welcome to the repository designed for tutorials that guide you through the
process of simulating and handling DESI data. A host of detailed tutorials can
also be found across various DESI code repositories. However, this particular
space serves primarily as a platform for:

* Tutorials that were demonstrated at specific DESI meetings, each segregated
  under directories marked by the date of the meeting. For example,
  meetings/Dec2020.
* Tutorials designed around wide-ranging subjects (like onskydata) or specific
  packages (such as fiberassign, redrock).
