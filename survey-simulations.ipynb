    "- Simulated stochastic weather (seeing, transparency, ...). See [DESI-3087](https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=3087) for details.\n",
    "- Afternoon planning, which updates tile observing priorities and schedules fiber assignment.\n",

Note that survey simulations operate at the level of tiles, not targets, and never generate spectra or redshifts and do not refer to any input catalog.  For a recent overview of the different DESI simluation types, see [DESI-3377](https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=3377).\n",

After working with the outputs from some existing simulations, you might want to run your own survey simulations: that tutorial is [here](http://surveysim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).
